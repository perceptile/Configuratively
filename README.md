# Configuratively

Configuratively is a file based database for storing your environment and application configuration. It is easy to get started and supports a variety of use cases to fit your project.

* Files are stored as JSON
* RESTful API and Command-Line interfaces for retreiving configuration.
* Mapped queries to model hierarchies to override configuration values.

Configuratively is written in C# and runs on the .NET platform but with an aim to work with [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) for cross-platform availability.

## Getting Started

Both the web service and command-line interfaces are bundled within the same application for simplicity.
